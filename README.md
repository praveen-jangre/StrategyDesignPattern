# The Strategy (A Behavioral Design Pattern)

The Strategy Behavioral Design Pattern defines a family of encapsulated algorithms, making them interchangeable.

Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms, each encapsulated in its own type.

## Purpose
* Manage multiple algorithms for a specific task
* Allow clients switch between different strategies
* Allows configuring a type with one of many behaviors

## Benefits
* Separates algorithm selection from algorithm implementation
* Useful for applications requiring algorithm variations
* Results in elegant, extensible code

## Structure
* Encapsulate algorithm-specific behavior
* Context maintains a reference to a strategy instance
* Context delegates client requests to strategy object

## Use case
* Streamline types that only vary in behavior
* Isolate clients from algorithm details
* Remove conditional logic for behavior selection

## Pitfalls
* Explosion of strategy types
* Clients must know available strategies
* Strategy switching can complicate the code
